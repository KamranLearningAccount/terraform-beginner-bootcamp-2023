### Debugging and Troubleshooting Checklist

1. **Did you use LLMs to research the issue?**
    1. What did you find?
    2. What do you think the issue is?

2. **Did you try and debug the issue?**  
   _Show what steps you have taken to debug and troubleshoot._

3. **Did you provide screenshots?**

4. **Did you provide a code example?**
    1. Did you use a code block?
    2. Did you use syntax highlighting?

5. **Did you commit code to a working branch?**
    1. _Did you share your working branch so we can investigate the code?_

6. **Before helping other boot campers**  
   _Guide them to it, do **not** give them the answer._

### Why This Matters
- **Clarity**: Proper formatting makes it easier to understand the checklist.
- **Efficiency**: A well-organized list saves time, especially when you're debugging or troubleshooting, which is crucial in your role as a Cloud Engineer. üõ†Ô∏è

# Copying the Template GitHub Project Repo


GitHub as a `template` feature that allows you to `Fork` repos and use that repo as a template!

- This is preferred method instead of forking it!

<aside>
üö® The name MUST be the same!

There are validators that require this name to be the same!

# Branching, Tagging, and Pull Requests

## How to Tag in GitHub

- **Tagging Syntax**: Use `git tag <tag>` to create a new tag.
- **Pushing Tags**: Use `git push --tags` to push the tag to GitHub.

```bash
gitpod /workspace/terraform-beginner-bootcamp-2023 (main) $ git tag 0.0.1-fixing
gitpod /workspace/terraform-beginner-bootcamp-2023 (main) $ git push --tags
```

![Alt text](note_assets/Braching_tagging_and_prs/Untitled.png)

- **Tag Creation**: The tag is now created within the GitHub CLI.
![Alt text](<note_assets/Braching_tagging_and_prs/Untitled 1.png>)

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Creating a tag does not create a GitHub release. A release can be created from the tag using the button on the top right of the screenshot.

## How to Create Issues and Branches in GitHub

- **Issue Numbering**: Each GitHub issue is assigned a unique number (e.g., `#1`).

<aside>
üí° **Tip**: You can create a new branch directly from the issue page. This branch will be automatically linked to the issue, enabling better tracking and auto-closing of issues when merged to the main branch.
</aside>

![Alt text](<note_assets/Braching_tagging_and_prs/Untitled 3.png>)


<aside>
üí° **Tip**: The new branch will have the issue number at the beginning of its name.
</aside>

![Alt text](<note_assets/Braching_tagging_and_prs/Untitled 4.png>)


- **Commit Linking**: Use the issue number in your commits to track them against the issue.

![Alt text](<note_assets/Braching_tagging_and_prs/Untitled 5.png>)

- **Pull Requests**: When creating a Pull Request, it will be linked to the issue if the branch was created from that issue.

![Alt text](<note_assets/Braching_tagging_and_prs/Untitled 6.png>)


<aside>
üí° **Best Practice**: Use `squash and merge` to consolidate commits into a single commit for a cleaner history.
</aside>

- **Auto-Closing Issues**: Merging the Pull Request will automatically close the linked issue.

![Alt text](<note_assets/Braching_tagging_and_prs/Untitled 7.png>)

- **Issue and PR Linking**: Hovering over `#1` will show the linked issue and the actual pull request.
